# tweet-bot
A basic python script which periodically tweets whatever tweet you want.
How to user the script:
1. Create your own twitter app using this link: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps. 
   Once you created your app, you will get api keys to use your app.
2. Open tokens.ini file and put your consumer key, consumer secret, access token key and access secret.
3. Add tweets into "tweets" list in the script.
4. If you want script to run automatically after your computer rebooted, first create a bat file that will run your python script then  create a shortcut which will run the bat file and put this shortcut to system startup folder.
